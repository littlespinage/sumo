lastV = v - ACCEL2SPEED(a) 
ACCEL2SPEED(a) = a * timestep

1. acceleration force at wheels 

tractionforce += mass * a * e + massOfLoads * a= 1.2425 * m * a + massOfLoads * a

for acceleration, some energy is converted to wheels' ratational kinetic energy
1.1 determination of mass factor e
e = 1 + e1 + e2
e1 = 0.04
e2 = 0.0025*i^2   --i is gear ratio, here we use i = 9
e = 1,2425

2. wind drag force

tractionforce += 0.5 * 1.2041 * frontalSurface * airDragCoefficient * v * v

2.1 frontal surface
A = 1.6 * 0.00056 * (mass - 765)

2.2 air drag coefficient 
airDragCoefficient = 0.28

3. roll drag force

tractionforce += rollDragCoefficient * 9.81 * cos(slope) * (mass + massOfPassenger)

3.1 roll drag coefficient 
rollDragCoefficient = 0.0127
source: Experimental Test Campaign on a Battery Electric Vehicle: Laboratory Test Results. P102

4. gravity 
tractionforce = (mass + massOfLoads) * 9.81 * sin(slope)

5. motor efficiency
MotorTorque = tractionforce * wheelRadius / 9


5.1 gear ratio is 9(emprical mean value)
5.2 wheel radius = 640/2 = 320 mm = 0.32m
Nissan Leaf 2011. Tire sizes = 195/65 R15 â€“ 225/35 R19(635mm-640)

6. gear efficiency: we can assume it is a constant value
(0.846+0.854+0.869+0.753+0.76+0.8)=0.814

7. when recuperating, some energy was consumed by hydraulic braking.
